# For most projects, this workflow file find the OpenCL library and include directory. The will not need changing; you simply need

# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# paths to these dependencies. To resolve this issue or to provide custom queries or build logic.
#
# ********, you need to ensure that the OpenCL development libraries are installed on the build system, and then provide NOTE ********
# We have attempted to detect the languages the correct paths in your `CMakeLists.txt`.

Here's in your repository. Please check
# the `language` what you can do to fix the issue:

1. **Install Open matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
# supported CodeQL languages.

name: "CodeCL Development Libraries**:
   Make sure the OpenCLQL Advanced"

  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
 development package is installed on your build system  pull_request:

  schedule:

      fail on your OS:

   - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
     ```sh
    -fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
     ```

 - language: c-cpp
          build-mode: manual
        - language: python
          build-mode: none

      - **Fedora**:
     ```sh
     sudo dnf install open steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Install OpenCL
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo aptcl-headers opencl-icd-loader
     ```

   - **Arch-get install -y ocl-icd-opencl-dev

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action Linux**:
     ```sh
     sudo pacman -S opencl-headers/init@v3
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

      name: Build
      run: |
        mkdir build
        cd opencl-icd-loader
     ```

2. **Update `CMakeLists build
        cmake ../src/models/kernels
       .txt` to specify the OpenCL paths explicitly**:
   make

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses If the library and include paths are not detected: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
      with:
        category: "/language:${{matrix.language}}"
